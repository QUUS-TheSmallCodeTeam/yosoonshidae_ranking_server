# Cost-Spec Ratio Double-Counting Problem: Mathematical Analysis with Business Logic

## Problem Context: Why We Need This Solution

### The Core Goal: Fair Plan Value Calculation

Your Cost-Spec ratio system aims to answer: **"Which mobile plans offer the best value for money?"** To do this fairly, you need a baseline that represents what each plan *should* cost based on its features.

**Current Problem:**
- **Invalid Baselines**: Current method creates impossible baseline costs by summing complete plan prices
- **Unfair Comparisons**: Plans are ranked based on mathematical artifacts rather than actual value
- **Goal Impossibility**: Cannot achieve fair plan ranking when baseline calculation is fundamentally flawed

## Mathematical Problem Formulation

The fundamental issue in your Cost-Spec ratio system is the **bundled cost decomposition problem** in econometric analysis. Given a set of mobile plans P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} where each plan pᵢ has features fᵢ = (dᵢ, vᵢ, sᵢ, tᵢ, ...) and cost cᵢ, your current frontier method creates:

```
F_data(d) = min{cᵢ | dᵢ ≥ d}
F_voice(v) = min{cᵢ | vᵢ ≥ v}  
F_SMS(s) = min{cᵢ | sᵢ ≥ s}
```

**Logic**: These frontiers correctly identify the minimum cost to obtain each feature level—this part of your system works perfectly for finding cost-efficient thresholds.

The baseline cost calculation becomes:
```
B(f) = F_data(d) + F_voice(v) + F_SMS(s) + F_tethering(t) + ...
```

**Mathematical Issue:** Each F_feature(x) represents a complete bundled cost cᵢ from potentially different plans. Therefore:
```
B(f) = c_j + c_k + c_l + c_m + ... where j,k,l,m are different plan indices
```

**Logical Problem**: This creates an invalid baseline by summing complete bundled costs from different plans, making it impossible to fairly measure plan efficiency.

## Empirical Demonstration Using Your Actual Data

### Real Frontier Structure from Your Dataset

**Data Analysis**: Your `processed_data_20250609_050018.csv` shows how the current method compounds the problem:

**Data Frontier (basic_data_clean):**
```
1GB  -> ₩3,960 (from plan: 1GB, 100min, 50SMS, 0GB tether)
2GB  -> ₩5,500 (from plan: 2GB, 100min, 100SMS, 2GB tether)  
6GB  -> ₩6,000 (from plan: 6GB, 300min, 300SMS, 6GB tether)
15GB -> ₩11,000 (from plan: 15GB, 300min, 300SMS, 0GB tether)
```

**Problem Illustration**: Each data tier comes from a complete plan with bundled features:
- **1GB frontier point**: Actually represents (1GB + 100min + 50SMS + 0GB tether) at ₩3,960
- **6GB frontier point**: Actually represents (6GB + 300min + 300SMS + 6GB tether) at ₩6,000  
- **15GB frontier point**: Actually represents (15GB + 300min + 300SMS + 0GB tether) at ₩11,000

**Voice Frontier (voice_clean):**
```
100min -> ₩3,960 (from plan: 1GB, 100min, 50SMS, 0GB tether)
300min -> ₩6,000 (from plan: 6GB, 300min, 300SMS, 6GB tether)
350min -> ₩9,900 (from plan: 6GB, 350min, 100SMS, 0GB tether)
```

**Problem Continuation**: Voice frontiers also represent complete bundled plans:
- **100min frontier point**: Actually represents (1GB + 100min + 50SMS + 0GB tether) at ₩3,960
- **300min frontier point**: Actually represents (6GB + 300min + 300SMS + 6GB tether) at ₩6,000
- **350min frontier point**: Actually represents (6GB + 350min + 100SMS + 0GB tether) at ₩9,900

### Why This Breaks Fair Value Calculation

For **Plan: 티플 가성비(300분/6GB)** with actual cost ₩6,000:

```
B_current = F_data(6GB) + F_voice(300min) + F_SMS(300) + F_tethering(6GB)
B_current = ₩6,000 + ₩6,000 + ₩6,000 + ₩6,000 = ₩24,000

CS_ratio = B_current / actual_cost = ₩24,000 / ₩6,000 = 4.0
```

**Logical Problem**: This says the plan should cost ₩24,000 when it actually costs ₩6,000, making it appear 4x more valuable than it should be. But the baseline is invalid because you're counting the same ₩6,000 complete plan cost four times, not calculating what the individual features should actually cost.

### Why Multi-Plan Combinations Make It Worse

**Example**: Consider calculating baseline for a plan with (10GB, 350min, 200SMS, 4GB tether):

```
F_data(10GB)     ≈ ₩8,500 (interpolated between different complete plans)
F_voice(350min)  = ₩9,900 (from a different complete plan)
F_SMS(200)       ≈ ₩5,750 (interpolated between different complete plans)  
F_tethering(4GB) ≈ ₩5,750 (interpolated between different complete plans)

B_invalid = ₩8,500 + ₩9,900 + ₩5,750 + ₩5,750 = ₩29,900
```

**Logical Error**: Now you're summing costs from 4+ different complete plans to create a baseline for one plan. This creates an impossible reference point—no actual plan costs ₩29,900 for these features, making fair comparison impossible.

## Why We Need Linear Decomposition

### The Core Solution Requirements

**1. Calculate Individual Feature Costs**
- **Current Problem**: Can only get bundled complete plan costs from frontiers
- **Required Solution**: Must extract what each feature individually contributes to cost

**2. Create Valid Baselines**
- **Current Problem**: Baselines are mathematical impossibilities (sum of multiple complete plans)
- **Required Solution**: Baselines must represent achievable costs using individual feature costs

**3. Enable Fair Comparisons**
- **Current Problem**: Rankings based on invalid baseline calculations
- **Required Solution**: Rankings based on what plans actually should cost vs. what they do cost

## Proposed Solution: Constrained Linear Decomposition

### Why Linear Decomposition Solves Our Problem

**Why Linear Decomposition?**
To calculate fair plan baselines, we need to know: *"What does each feature actually cost individually?"* This is the only way to:
- **Build valid baselines**: Sum individual feature costs instead of complete plan costs
- **Enable fair comparisons**: Compare plans against achievable cost targets  
- **Preserve frontier logic**: Use your existing frontier discoveries as constraints

### Mathematical Framework

Model each plan cost as a linear combination of true marginal costs:
```
cᵢ = β₀ + β₁dᵢ + β₂vᵢ + β₃sᵢ + β₄tᵢ + εᵢ
```

**Business Interpretation:**
- β₀ = **Infrastructure cost** (network maintenance, customer service, billing systems)
- β₁ = **Per-GB data cost** (spectrum, backhaul, equipment amortization)
- β₂ = **Per-minute voice cost** (switching, interconnect fees)
- β₃ = **Per-SMS cost** (usually negligible, bundled for customer acquisition)
- β₄ = **Per-GB tethering cost** (premium feature, higher support costs)

### The Constraint System

**Business Logic**: We must respect your frontier discoveries because they represent **real market minimums**—no carrier can profitably go below these prices.

```
For each frontier point (x*, c*): β₀ + Σⱼ βⱼxⱼ* ≤ c* + δ
```

**Business Meaning**: Our decomposed costs must never suggest a plan can be priced below what's already proven achievable in the market.

**Applied to your data:**
```
β₀ + β₁(1) + β₂(100) + β₃(50) + β₄(0) ≤ ₩3,960 + δ
β₀ + β₁(6) + β₂(300) + β₃(300) + β₄(6) ≤ ₩6,000 + δ  
β₀ + β₁(15) + β₂(300) + β₃(300) + β₄(0) ≤ ₩11,000 + δ
```

**Constraint Logic (Data-Driven Only):**
1. **Non-negativity:** βⱼ ≥ 0 (costs cannot be negative - mathematical/economic requirement)
2. **Frontier respect:** β₀ + Σⱼ βⱼxⱼ* ≥ c* - δ (solution cannot go below your discovered minimums)

**No arbitrary bounds** - all constraints come from your data or logical necessity.

## Three-Stage Implementation: Business-Driven Approach

### Stage 1: Representative Point Selection

**Business Objective**: Extract the most informative plans that reveal different carrier strategies and market segments.

**Strategic Value**: Your actual frontier data reveals:
```
Representatives = {
  (1GB, 100min, 50SMS, 0GB) -> ₩3,960,    # Budget segment strategy
  (2GB, 100min, 100SMS, 2GB) -> ₩5,500,   # Entry-level with tethering
  (6GB, 300min, 300SMS, 6GB) -> ₩6,000,   # Balanced mainstream offering  
  (6GB, 350min, 100SMS, 0GB) -> ₩9,900,   # Voice-focused premium
  (15GB, 300min, 300SMS, 0GB) -> ₩11,000  # Data-heavy no-tethering
}
```

**Business Insight**: This selection captures different market positioning strategies:
- **Budget optimization** (minimize everything)
- **Feature balance** (optimize for typical usage)  
- **Specialized focus** (optimize for specific high-usage patterns)

### Stage 2: Constrained Linear System Solution

**Business Logic**: Solve for the costs that explain these diverse strategies while respecting market constraints.

**Management Interpretation**: "Given that these five different market strategies exist profitably, what must the underlying cost structure be?"

#### Mathematical Solution Method

**Mathematical Principle**: We need to solve the fundamental equation:
```
plan_cost = base_cost + feature₁×cost₁ + feature₂×cost₂ + ...
```

For multiple plans simultaneously to find the unknown cost coefficients.

**Step 2.1: Construct the Linear System**
```
X·β = c

Where:
X = [
  [1, 1,  100, 50,  0 ],  # Budget plan: (1GB, 100min, 50SMS, 0GB tether) -> ₩3,960
  [1, 2,  100, 100, 2 ],  # Entry plan: (2GB, 100min, 100SMS, 2GB tether) -> ₩5,500
  [1, 6,  300, 300, 6 ],  # Balanced plan: (6GB, 300min, 300SMS, 6GB tether) -> ₩6,000
  [1, 6,  350, 100, 0 ],  # Voice-focused: (6GB, 350min, 100SMS, 0GB tether) -> ₩9,900
  [1, 15, 300, 300, 0 ]   # Data-heavy: (15GB, 300min, 300SMS, 0GB tether) -> ₩11,000
]

β = [β₀, β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄]ᵀ  # [base_cost, data_cost/GB, voice_cost/100min, SMS_cost/100, tether_cost/GB]
c = [3960, 5500, 6000, 9900, 11000]ᵀ
```

**Why This Matrix Setup Works:**

Each row in X represents one equation. For example, row 1 says:
```
₩3,960 = β₀ + β₁(1) + β₂(100) + β₃(50) + β₄(0)
₩3,960 = β₀ + β₁ + 100β₂ + 50β₃ + 0β₄
```

This means: "A plan with 1GB, 100min, 50SMS, 0GB tethering costs ₩3,960. What combination of base cost + marginal costs explains this?"

With 5 plans, we get 5 equations with 5 unknowns (the β coefficients):
```
Plan 1: ₩3,960 = β₀ + 1β₁ + 100β₂ + 50β₃ + 0β₄
Plan 2: ₩5,500 = β₀ + 2β₁ + 100β₂ + 100β₃ + 2β₄  
Plan 3: ₩6,000 = β₀ + 6β₁ + 300β₂ + 300β₃ + 6β₄
Plan 4: ₩9,900 = β₀ + 6β₁ + 350β₂ + 100β₃ + 0β₄
Plan 5: ₩11,000 = β₀ + 15β₁ + 300β₂ + 300β₃ + 0β₄
```

**Step 2.2: Solve Data-Driven Constrained Optimization**

**Mathematical Principle**: We can't just solve X·β = c directly because:
1. We need to respect your frontier constraints (solutions can't violate discovered minimums)
2. We need non-negative costs (negative marginal costs are impossible)

So we use constrained optimization instead of simple linear algebra.

The constraints should come from your data, not arbitrary bounds. We solve:

```
minimize: ||X·β - c||₂²  (least squares objective)

subject to:
1. βⱼ ≥ 0 ∀j ∈ {1,2,3,4}       (non-negative marginal costs - economic requirement)
2. X[i]·β ≤ c[i] + δ ∀i        (frontier constraints - from your data)
3. β₀ ≥ min(c) - max_feature_value × max_reasonable_β  (data-driven minimum base cost)
```

**Mathematical Meaning of Constraints:**

**1. Non-negativity (βⱼ ≥ 0):**
```
β₁ ≥ 0, β₂ ≥ 0, β₃ ≥ 0, β₄ ≥ 0
```
**Why needed**: Negative marginal costs are mathematically nonsensical (would mean paying less for more features).

**2. Frontier Constraints (X[i]·β ≥ c[i] - δ):**
```
For each frontier plan i: β₀ + β₁×data[i] + β₂×voice[i] + ... ≥ actual_cost[i] - tolerance
```
**Why needed**: Your decomposed costs must never suggest a plan can be cheaper than already-proven market minimums.

**What actual_cost[i] means**: This is the `original_fee` of the plan that created the frontier point. For example:
- If your data frontier shows "6GB → ₩6,000", then actual_cost = ₩6,000 
- This came from a real plan in your dataset with original_fee = ₩6,000 that had 6GB data
- The constraint ensures our decomposed model predicts at least ₩6,000 for that feature combination

**Direction of constraint**: 
- **≥ (greater than or equal)**: Prevents going BELOW proven minimums
- We allow predictions to be higher than frontier costs (that's fine - means less efficient)
- We prevent predictions below frontier costs (impossible - would beat proven market minimums)

**3. Base Cost Feasibility:**
```
β₀ ≥ minimum_mathematically_possible (calculated from data)
```
**Why needed**: Ensure the system of equations has a valid solution.

**Step 2.3: Implementation using Quadratic Programming**

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize
import numpy as np

def solve_for_coefficients(X, c, tolerance=500):
    """

    def objective(beta):
        residuals = X @ beta - c
        return np.sum(residuals ** 2)
    
    # Mathematical Meaning: We want the β coefficients that make our 
    # predictions (X @ beta) as close as possible to actual costs (c).

    bounds = [

print(f"β₃ (SMS): ₩{coefficients[3]:.0f}/100msg")
print(f"β₄ (tethering): ₩{coefficients[4]:.0f}/GB")
```

**Business Validation of Solution:**
Once we obtain the β coefficients, validate them:

1. **Frontier Consistency Check**: Verify X·β ≤ c + tolerance for all frontier plans
2. **Economic Reasonableness**: Ensure coefficients align with telecom industry economics
3. **Prediction Accuracy**: Test on held-out plans not used in frontier construction

**Data-Driven Solution Process:**
The optimization will find the β coefficients that:
1. **Best explain your actual plan prices** (minimize prediction error)
2. **Respect your frontier constraints** (never violate discovered market minimums) 
3. **Satisfy economic logic** (non-negative costs only)

**No arbitrary bounds** - the solution emerges purely from your data!

## Mathematical Principle Explanation

### Why Matrix Operations Work

**The Core Concept**: We're solving a "system of linear equations" where each equation represents one plan's cost structure.

**Simple Example with 2 Plans and 2 Features:**
```
Plan A: 5GB + 200min = ₩5,000
Plan B: 10GB + 100min = ₩7,000

Written as equations:
₩5,000 = β₀ + 5×β₁ + 200×β₂
₩7,000 = β₀ + 10×β₁ + 100×β₂

In matrix form:
[1  5  200] [β₀]   [5000]
[1 10  100] [β₁] = [7000]
            [β₂]
```

**What the Matrix Multiplication (X @ β) Does:**
```
X @ β = [1  5  200] [β₀]   [β₀ + 5β₁ + 200β₂]
        [1 10  100] [β₁] = [β₀ + 10β₁ + 100β₂]
                    [β₂]
```

This gives us predicted costs for each plan based on our β coefficients.

**What the Optimization Does:**
```
minimize: ||X @ β - c||₂² 

means: minimize: (predicted_cost₁ - actual_cost₁)² + (predicted_cost₂ - actual_cost₂)² + ...
```

Find the β coefficients that make our predictions closest to reality.

**Why Constraints Matter:**
Without constraints, the optimizer might find mathematically perfect but nonsensical solutions like:
- β₁ = -₩100/GB (negative data cost - impossible)
- β₀ + 6β₁ + 300β₂ + ... = ₩5,000 when your frontier shows this combination costs at least ₩6,000

Constraints force the solution to be both mathematically optimal AND logically valid.

### Stage 3: Decomposed Baseline Calculation

**Business Application**: Now calculate what a plan *should* cost based on true market economics:

```
B_decomposed(f) = β₀ + β₁d + β₂v + β₃s + β₄t
```

**Strategic Value**: This baseline represents **economically efficient pricing** rather than an impossible hybrid of different carriers' complete strategies.

## Expected Business Results

### Market Structure Insights

Based on Korean telecom market analysis, the decomposition should reveal:

```
β₀ ≈ ₩2,000-3,000  # Basic service cost (unavoidable infrastructure)
β₁ ≈ ₩10-50 per GB # Data is nearly free (infrastructure already built)
β₂ ≈ ₩20-40 per 100min # Voice has real spectrum costs
β₃ ≈ ₩1-10 per 100SMS # SMS bundled for customer acquisition
β₄ ≈ ₩100-200 per GB tethering # Premium feature with higher support costs
```

**Business Implications:**
- **Data commoditization**: Low marginal cost explains aggressive data bundling
- **Voice value retention**: Still meaningful revenue source
- **SMS bundling strategy**: Used as competitive differentiator, not profit center
- **Tethering premium**: Legitimate premium pricing for specialized feature

### Competitive Strategy Applications

**1. New Plan Development**
- **Before**: "Let's bundle features from the cheapest sources" (impossible)
- **After**: "Data costs ₩25/GB, so we can competitively price 20GB at β₀ + ₩500"

**2. Competitive Response**
- **Before**: "Their plan seems 3x better than ours" (artifact)
- **After**: "They're pricing data at ₩15/GB vs our ₩30/GB—time to optimize"

**3. Market Positioning**
- **Before**: Rankings based on mathematical impossibilities
- **After**: Rankings based on actual economic efficiency vs real market costs
