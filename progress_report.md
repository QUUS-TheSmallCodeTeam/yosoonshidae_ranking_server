# Cost-Spec Implementation Progress Report

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented the new Cost-Spec (CS) Ratio method to replace the existing DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) method. This provides users with a more intuitive and transparent way to evaluate mobile plans.

### 6. Ensure Client Compatibility
- **Goal**: Maintain compatibility with the Supabase edge function that submits data
- **Specific Steps**:
  - [x] Ensure the `/process` endpoint response structure includes all fields used by client code:
    - [x] `top_10_plans` and `all_ranked_plans` arrays
    - [x] `plan_id` or `id` field for each plan
    - [x] `rank_display` or `rank` field (string format with proper formatting)
    - [x] `rank_number` field (numeric ranking)
    - [x] `value_ratio` field (map CS ratio to this field)
  - [x] Test with the actual edge function that submits data
- **Verification**:
  - [x] Verify the Supabase edge function can successfully process the response
  - [x] Confirm that ranking data is properly formatted for database storage
  - [x] Test end-to-end flow from data submission to database storage

### 7. Integration Testing

- **Specific Steps**:
  - [x] Test end-to-end process through `/process` endpoint
  - [x] Validate report generation with CS ratio results
  - [x] Test with various input formats and options
- **Verification**:
  - [x] Confirm rankings are calculated correctly
  - [x] Verify report formatting and structure
  - [x] Test edge cases and error conditions

## Cost-Spec Ratio Implementation Details

The Cost-Spec (CS) ratio method calculates plan value through these steps:

1. **Baseline Feature Costs**: For each feature value, find the minimum fee among plans with that value
2. **Plan Baseline Cost (B)**: Sum the baseline costs for all features in the plan
3. **Cost-Spec Ratio**: Calculate CS = B / actual_fee (higher is better)
4. **Ranking**: Sort plans by CS ratio (descending)

This method objectively measures each plan's value by comparing its cost to a theoretical minimum cost for its features.

### Implementation in cost_spec.py
- [x] Define feature sets
```python
FEATURE_SETS = {
    'basic': [
        'basic_data_clean', 'basic_data_unlimited',
        'daily_data_clean', 'daily_data_unlimited',
        'voice_clean', 'voice_unlimited',
        'message_clean', 'message_unlimited',
        'additional_call', 'is_5g',
        'tethering_gb', 'has_throttled_data',
        'has_unlimited_speed', 'speed_when_exhausted'
    ]
}
```
- [x] Define unlimited flag mappings
```python
UNLIMITED_FLAGS = {
    'basic_data_clean': 'basic_data_unlimited',
    'daily_data_clean': 'daily_data_unlimited',
    'voice_clean': 'voice_unlimited',
    'message_clean': 'message_unlimited',
    'speed_when_exhausted': 'has_unlimited_speed'
}
```
- [x] Implement baseline cost calculation functions:
  - [x] `calculate_baseline_costs()` - Find minimum fees for each feature value
  - [x] `calculate_plan_baseline_cost()` - Sum feature costs for a plan
- [x] Implement CS ratio functions:
  - [x] `calculate_cs_ratio()` - Compute CS ratio (B/fee)
  - [x] `rank_plans_by_cs()` - Rank plans based on CS ratio
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings for all functions

### Response Structure for `/process` Endpoint
The `/process` endpoint now returns the following structure, compatible with the Supabase edge function:

```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "message": "Data processing complete using Cost-Spec method",
  "status": "success",
  "processing_time_seconds": 0.1234,
  "options": {
    "featureSet": "basic",
    "feeColumn": "fee"
  },
  "ranking_method": "cs",
  "top_10_plans": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "plan_name": "Example Plan",
      "mvno": "Example Provider",
      "fee": 15000,
      "original_fee": 18000,
      "rank_number": 1,
      "B": 12000,
      "CS": 0.8,
      "rank_display": "1",
      "value_ratio": 0.8
    },
    // More plans...
  ],
  "all_ranked_plans": [
    // All plans with the same structure
  ]
}
```
