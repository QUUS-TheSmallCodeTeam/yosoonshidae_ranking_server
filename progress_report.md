# DEA Implementation Progress Report

## Current Status
All previous refactoring tasks have been completed. The current focus is on replacing the Spearman method completely with the DEA method for the `/process` endpoint.

## DEA Implementation Tasks

### 1. Replace Spearman with DEA in the `/process` Endpoint
- **Goal**: Modify the `/process` endpoint to use DEA instead of Spearman
- **Specific Steps**:
  - [✓] Update the endpoint function to use `calculate_rankings_with_dea`
  - [✓] Add support for DEA-specific parameters (feature_set, target_variable, rts)
  - [✓] Update response structure to include DEA metrics
  - [✓] Ensure proper error handling for DEA-specific issues
- **Verification**:
  - [✓] Test with sample data to verify DEA calculations
  - [✓] Confirm response structure includes all necessary DEA metrics
  - [✓] Verify error handling for edge cases

### 2. Remove the `/upload-csv` Endpoint
- **Goal**: Consolidate all functionality into the `/process` endpoint
- **Specific Steps**:
  - [✓] Move any unique functionality from `/upload-csv` to `/process`
  - [✓] Remove the `/upload-csv` endpoint
  - [✓] Update documentation to reflect the changes
- **Verification**:
  - [✓] Verify all functionality is available through `/process`
  - [✓] Confirm `/upload-csv` is properly removed
  - [✓] Check documentation for accuracy

### 3. Update App Title and Documentation
- **Goal**: Reflect the change to DEA in the app title and documentation
- **Specific Steps**:
  - [✓] Change app title to "Moyo Plan Ranking Model Server - DEA Method"
  - [✓] Update endpoint documentation to reflect DEA methodology
  - [✓] Update any references to Spearman in the codebase
- **Verification**:
  - [✓] Verify app title is updated
  - [✓] Check documentation for accuracy
  - [✓] Ensure no references to Spearman remain in user-facing content

### 4. Update Report Generation
- **Goal**: Ensure reports properly display DEA metrics
- **Specific Steps**:
  - [✓] Update report generation to handle DEA-specific metrics
  - [✓] Use DEA directory structure for report paths
  - [✓] Ensure consistent display between Spearman and DEA reports
- **Verification**:
  - [✓] Verify reports display DEA scores and rankings correctly
  - [✓] Check report formatting and structure
  - [✓] Test with various input data

### 5. Integration Testing
- **Goal**: Verify complete DEA implementation
- **Specific Steps**:
  - [ ] Test end-to-end DEA ranking process through `/process`
  - [ ] Validate report generation with DEA results
  - [ ] Test with various input formats and options
- **Verification**:
  - [ ] Confirm rankings are consistent with DEA methodology
  - [ ] Verify report formatting and structure
  - [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

### 6. Bug Fixes and Optimizations
- **Goal**: Address any issues found during testing
- **Specific Steps**:
  - [✓] Fix missing `time` module import in app.py
  - [✓] Fix column name mismatch in DEA implementation
  - [ ] Verify all necessary imports are present
  - [ ] Check for any other potential runtime errors
- **Verification**:
  - [ ] Test the `/process` endpoint after fixes
  - [ ] Confirm no runtime errors occur
  - [ ] Verify response structure is correct

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the full endpoint flow with sample data
   - Verify response formats match expected structure
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test with malformed inputs to ensure proper error responses
   - Check edge cases like empty plan lists

## Progress Tracking

| Task | Started | Completed | Notes |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1. Create or Update Spearman Module | 2025-05-03 | Completed | Created modules/spearman.py and verified implementation matches original |
| 2. Refactor Tied Ranking Logic | 2025-05-03 | Completed | Added calculate_rankings_with_ties to modules/ranking.py with the "공동" prefix fix |
| 3. Create or Update Report Generation Module | 2025-05-03 | Completed | Created modules/report.py with matching HTML generation logic |
| 4. Clean Up app.py | 2025-05-03 | Completed | Updated imports and verified API endpoints use refactored functions |
| 5. Remove Unused Code | 2025-05-03 | Completed | Removed XGBoost-specific code with no impact on execution flow |

## Issues and Blockers

List any issues encountered during refactoring:

- Fixed missing `time` module import in app.py that was causing runtime errors
- Fixed column name mismatch in DEA implementation (updated feature set definitions to use correct column names like 'basic_data_clean' instead of 'data')

## Final Verification

When all tasks are complete, run these final verification steps:

- [  ] All endpoints return expected responses with test data
- [  ] No unused functions or imports remain in codebase
- [  ] Code passes all linting checks
- [  ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new structure
- [  ] Code file sizes reduced to target metrics (app.py < 500 lines)
