## 🔍 **Current Investigation - Data Source Discrepancy**

### **Immediate Priority: HTML Table vs Logs Mismatch**
- **Issue**: User sees incorrect coefficients in HTML table despite correct log values
  - HTML shows: `additional_call` ₩-1.9992, `data_stops` ₩-10649.9018
  - Logs show: `additional_call` ₩0.00, `data_stops` ₩-5000.00
- **Action needed**: Trace data flow from `get_coefficient_breakdown()` → HTML table
- **Suspected causes**:

2. **Add debug logging** to `generate_feature_rates_table_html()` to see input values
3. **Verify coefficient flow** from Ridge regression → breakdown → HTML table

## 🚨 **Current Issue - Multicollinearity Resolution** ⭐ **ROOT CAUSE: PERFECT CORRELATIONS**

### **Immediate Action Required**
- [ ] **Resolve multicollinearity in coefficient calculation**
  - Issue: 6 perfect/high correlations (>0.95) causing negative coefficients
  - Current: Basic Ridge regression (α=1.0) insufficient for perfect correlations
  - Required: Stronger regularization + remove perfectly correlated features
  - Impact: Eliminates negative coefficients, improves coefficient stability

### **Phase 1: Quick Fix**
- [ ] **Increase Ridge regularization**: Change α from 1.0 → 10.0 for stronger correlation handling
- [ ] **Remove perfect correlations**: Remove data_unlimited_speed, has_unlimited_speed from FEATURE_SETS  
- [ ] **Test coefficient stability**: Verify positive coefficients for economically sensible features

### **Phase 2: Advanced Solutions** 
- [ ] **Implement VIF calculation**: Add Variance Inflation Factor (VIF = 1/(1-R²)) for automatic feature selection
- [ ] **Feature importance ranking**: Economic logic-based selection when removing correlated features
- [ ] **Validation framework**: Compare coefficient stability across different multicollinearity solutions

## 📊 **Secondary Issues - Post-Fix**

### **Multicollinearity Management** (After pipeline fix)
- [ ] **Address perfect correlations in processed data**
  - `basic_data_unlimited ↔ data_unlimited_speed: 1.000`
  - `voice_unlimited ↔ message_unlimited: 0.968` 
  - `data_stops_after_quota ↔ data_throttled_after_quota: -0.986`
  - Consider feature selection or regularization adjustments

### **Coefficient Display** 
- [ ] **Fix coefficient breakdown parsing error**
  - Current error: `'<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'int'`
  - Ensure proper data type handling in get_coefficient_breakdown()

## ✅ **Investigation Complete**

### **Confirmed NOT Issues** (No action needed)
- ✅ **Multicollinearity in raw data**: Low correlations found
- ✅ **Economic logic violations**: Available features correlate positively with price  
- ✅ **Overfitting**: Adequate sample-to-feature ratio (1149:1)
- ✅ **Coefficient instability**: Stable across regularization levels
- ✅ **Data quality**: No significant outliers or corruption

### **Root Cause Confirmed**
- ✅ **Primary Issue**: Data preprocessing pipeline mismatch
  - Raw data lacks expected feature columns (`basic_data_clean`, `voice_clean`, etc.)
  - Preprocessing creates these columns from raw columns (`basic_data`, `voice`, etc.)
  - Coefficient calculation expects processed columns but receives raw data
  - Missing features default to zero coefficients → Economically incorrect results

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Pipeline Fix Validation**
- [ ] Feature Marginal Cost Coefficients table shows meaningful positive values for:
  - `basic_data_clean`: Positive per-GB cost
  - `voice_clean`: Positive per-minute cost  
  - `message_clean`: Positive per-message cost
  - `data_stops_after_quota`: Baseline reference cost
  - All other features: Economically sensible values

### **Technical Verification**
- [ ] All 16/16 expected features present in coefficient calculation
- [ ] No zero coefficients due to missing data
- [ ] Coefficient signs align with economic expectations
- [ ] System logs confirm preprocessing pipeline execution
